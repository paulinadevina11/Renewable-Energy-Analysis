In the Fortex 5.0 Data Science Competition, my team and I developed a data analysis model focused on renewable energy and waste management, utilizing datasets from various environmental sources. My responsibilities included data preprocessing, analysis, and model development to extract meaningful insights and identify key trends in sustainable energy usage and waste reduction strategies. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we aimed to support decision-making for a greener and more efficient environmental management system.

Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure it was ready for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
- Matplotlib for Visualization – Created insightful visual representations to analyze trends in renewable energy adoption and waste management efficiency.
- K-Means Clustering – Implemented clustering techniques to categorize regions based on energy consumption and waste management effectiveness.
- Linear Regression – Applied linear regression models to predict relationships between renewable energy use and waste management practices.
- Critical Thinking – Applied analytical reasoning to interpret data patterns and optimize data-driven environmental solutions.
